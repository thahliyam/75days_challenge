# 75days_challenge
This is a 75 days of data analysis challenge and already completed the 15 days excel challenge .Now here begins Powerbi .
Day 17
Power BI offers flexible connections to a wide variety of data sources, enabling robust integration across different formats and platforms. Users can connect to file-based sources like Excel or CSV, database sources such as SQL Server and MySQL, online services including SharePoint and Google Analytics, and cloud platforms like Azure and Amazon Redshift. Power BI supports two primary connection modes: Import Mode, which loads data into Power BI for faster queries but requires periodic refreshes, and DirectQuery Mode, which queries data directly from the source for real-time analysis, ideal for large datasets. Additionally, Composite Models combine Import and DirectQuery for optimized performance. To establish a connection, users select their data source type from the “Get Data” menu, specify connection settings, and configure any needed transformations in Power Query to ensure data is clean and structured for analysis. With these options, Power BI allows seamless data integration, empowering users to create insightful, data-driven reports and dashboards.

Day 18
Data modeling in Power BI is the process of organizing and structuring data to support efficient and insightful analysis. It involves importing data from various sources, defining relationships between tables, and creating calculated columns and measures to enhance reporting capabilities. By setting up relationships, such as one-to-many or many-to-many, users can link tables to ensure data is consistent and queries are optimized for performance. Power BI supports both Star and Snowflake schemas, with the star schema being preferred for simpler, faster querying. Best practices for data modeling in Power BI include using descriptive names, optimizing data types, and minimizing unnecessary calculated columns to ensure models are both efficient and easy to understand. A well-designed data model not only enhances data clarity but also powers more accurate, insightful visualizations that help drive informed decision-making.
