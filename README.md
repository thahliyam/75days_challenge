# 75days_challenge
This is a 75 days of data analysis challenge and already completed the 15 days excel challenge .Now here begins Powerbi .
Day 17
Power BI offers flexible connections to a wide variety of data sources, enabling robust integration across different formats and platforms. Users can connect to file-based sources like Excel or CSV, database sources such as SQL Server and MySQL, online services including SharePoint and Google Analytics, and cloud platforms like Azure and Amazon Redshift. Power BI supports two primary connection modes: Import Mode, which loads data into Power BI for faster queries but requires periodic refreshes, and DirectQuery Mode, which queries data directly from the source for real-time analysis, ideal for large datasets. Additionally, Composite Models combine Import and DirectQuery for optimized performance. To establish a connection, users select their data source type from the “Get Data” menu, specify connection settings, and configure any needed transformations in Power Query to ensure data is clean and structured for analysis. With these options, Power BI allows seamless data integration, empowering users to create insightful, data-driven reports and dashboards.

Day 18
Data modeling in Power BI is the process of organizing and structuring data to support efficient and insightful analysis. It involves importing data from various sources, defining relationships between tables, and creating calculated columns and measures to enhance reporting capabilities. By setting up relationships, such as one-to-many or many-to-many, users can link tables to ensure data is consistent and queries are optimized for performance. Power BI supports both Star and Snowflake schemas, with the star schema being preferred for simpler, faster querying. Best practices for data modeling in Power BI include using descriptive names, optimizing data types, and minimizing unnecessary calculated columns to ensure models are both efficient and easy to understand. A well-designed data model not only enhances data clarity but also powers more accurate, insightful visualizations that help drive informed decision-making.

Day 19
DAX is a powerful formula language that allows users to perform complex calculations and data analysis. Calculated columns are new columns added to existing tables, defined by DAX expressions, and are useful for categorizing or transforming data that needs to be stored in memory. On the other hand, measures are calculations that are evaluated dynamically based on the context of the visual or report, making them essential for aggregating metrics like totals, averages, and KPIs. Understanding the key differences between calculated columns and measures is vital, as measures are generally preferred for their memory efficiency and flexibility. This document emphasizes best practices for using DAX, including the use of context-aware functions and performance monitoring tools. By leveraging calculated columns and measures effectively, Power BI users can build robust data models that drive insightful analysis and informed decision-making.

Day20
This README provides an overview of designing interactive visualizations in Power BI, emphasizing the importance of user engagement and data exploration. Interactive visualizations allow users to manipulate and explore data through features such as filters, slicers, drill-through, and custom tooltips, enhancing the analytical experience. The document outlines key components, including various chart types, the use of slicers and filters, and best practices for clarity, consistency, and responsive design. It details the steps for creating these visualizations, from data preparation to testing and iteration, while also highlighting advanced features like bookmarks, what-if parameters, and custom visuals. By leveraging these techniques, users can create compelling and intuitive visual narratives that drive deeper insights and facilitate informed decision-making.

Day21
This repository contains a comprehensive exploration of Power BI’s AI capabilities, specifically focusing on the Quick Insights feature. Quick Insights utilizes advanced machine learning algorithms to automatically analyze datasets, revealing hidden patterns, trends, and outliers with minimal user intervention. The project showcases how this feature enhances data exploration by generating visually intuitive insights, making it easier for users to interpret complex data quickly. Additionally, the repository highlights complementary AI tools within Power BI, such as Q&A for natural language queries, Smart Narratives for AI-generated textual summaries, and Cognitive Services for advanced data analysis. Each section provides examples and best practices for effectively leveraging these tools to drive data-informed decisions and improve overall analytical workflows. This project aims to empower users of all skill levels to harness the full potential of Power BI’s AI-driven insights for better data management and visualization.

Day22
This repository contains resources and examples for creating and sharing interactive Power BI reports, designed to transform raw data into actionable insights. Through detailed guides on data import, transformation, modeling, visualization, and sharing, this project covers the complete workflow of Power BI report development. Here, you’ll find sample reports, DAX formulas, Power Query transformations, and best practices to enhance report interactivity and optimize performance. Additionally, the repository offers guidance on publishing to Power BI Service, scheduling data refreshes, and sharing dashboards securely with stakeholders. Whether you’re a beginner or a seasoned data analyst, this collection will support you in building impactful, data-driven reports with Power BI.
